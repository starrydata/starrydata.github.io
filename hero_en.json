  "description": "Based on inorganic solid-state chemistry, we engage in Materials Informatics (MI) that integrates experiments, calculations, and data science.<br>Through the Starrydata project, which I planned and led, we collected and structured over 200,000 curves of materials property data from graph images in published papers to build a large-scale database.<br>Starrydata is utilized in cutting-edge research as the world's largest experimental database of thermoelectric materials.<br>In the future, we aim to become the foundation for experimental MI research worldwide as a massive database that digitizes experimental data across all of materials science."
